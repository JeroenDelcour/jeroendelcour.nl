    | Hi, I'm Jeroen Delcour. I dabble in programming, web design, video game development, and general geekiness.

    | Over time, these hobbies have resulted in a modest collection of programming doodads, web design thingamajigs, video game development tomfoolery, and general geeky gismos. A word of warning: some of these are highly experimental and liable to explode (a.k.a. buggy).
